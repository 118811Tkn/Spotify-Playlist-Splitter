# Spotify-Playlist-Splitter
Splits big spotify playlists into smaller chunks.
Picture this. You just started paying for Apple Music because it's simply superior to Spotify, but when you went to transfer your playlists over to Apple Music with SongShift or something, you were hit by a 200 songs per playlist limit. That's what happened to me and i didn't want to pay more for something i'll use one time, so i created this script.

DEPENDENCIES:

You'll need a CSV file of your playlist, this is done because i'm too lazy to code in a more complex soultion. This project is configured to read CSV files generated by [exportify.net](https://exportify.net)

Python3, get it from wherever, just google it.
Spotipy, install this with `pip3 install spotipy` in a command line after installing python.

HOW TO USE

1. Get a spotify developer application (free!) from [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), just log in, agree to the terms, press create app, set the name and description to whatever you want, set the redirect URLs to http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback (THIS IS A CRUCIAL STEP. MAKE SURE TO DO THIS!) and press save. Keep this tab open for later, you'll need it.
Download the script to the place where your CSV file is located
